Add support for `--constrain-python-ver` (accepting X.Y or X.Y.Z) in `invoke lock`.
Updates `pyproject.toml` with the minimum Python patch version when required (e.g. 3.9.3),
and adjusts CI to pass the correct constraint per matrix. This prevents dependency resolution
drift on newer runners and keeps the lockfile consistent with the runtime environment.
